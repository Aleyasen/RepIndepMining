# RepIndepMining
Codes/Experiments for Representation Independence of Structural Similarity Algorithms Over Graph Databases Research

## Introduction
Graph analytics algorithms leverage quantifiable structural properties of the data to predict interesting concepts and relationships. The same information, however, can be represented using many different structures and the structural properties observed over particular representations do not necessarily hold for alternative structures. Because these algorithms tend to be highly effective over some choices of structure, such as that of the databases used to validate them, but not so effective with others, graph analytics has largely remained the province of experts who can find the desired forms for these algorithms. We argue that in order to make graph analytics usable, we should develop systems that are effective over a wide range of choices of structural organizations.
